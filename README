lthread
=======

Introduction
------------

lthread is a multicore/multithread coroutine library written in C. It uses [Sam Rushing's](https://github.com/samrushing) _swap function to swap lthreads. What's special about lthread is that it allows you to make *blocking calls* and *expensive* computations, blocking IO inside a coroutine, providing you with the advantages of coroutines and pthreads. See the http server example below. 

lthreads are created in userspace and don't require kernel intervention, they are light weight and ideal for socket programming. Each lthread have separate stack, and  the stack is madvise(2)-ed to save space, allowing you to create thousands(tested with a million lthreads) of coroutines and maintain a low memory footprint. The scheduler is hidden from the user and is created automagically in each pthread, allowing the user to take advantage of cpu cores and distribute the load by creating several pthreads, each running it's own lthread scheduler and handling its own share of coroutines. Locks are necessary when accessing global variables from lthreads running in different pthreads, and lthreads must not block on pthread condition variables as this will block the whole lthread scheduler in the pthread.

![](https://github.com/halayli/lthread/blob/master/images/lthread_scheduler.png?raw=true "Lthread scheduler")

To run an lthread scheduler in each pthread, launch a pthread and create lthreads using lthread_create() followed by lthread_run() in each pthread.


### lthread scheduler's inner works

The scheduler is build around epoll/kqueue and uses an rbtree to track which lthreads needs to run next.

If you need to execute an expensive computation or make a blocking call inside an lthread, you can surround the block of code with `lthread_compute_begin()` and `lthread_compute_end()`, which moves the lthread into an lthread_compute_scheduler that runs in its own pthread to avoid blocking other lthreads. lthread_compute_schedulers are created when needed and they die after 60 seconds of inactivity. `lthread_compute_begin()` tries to pick an already created and free lthread_compute_scheduler before it creates a new one.

Installation
------------

Currently, lthread is supported on FreeBSD, OS X,  and Linux.

To build and install, simply:

    cmake .
    sudo make install

Usage
-----

`#include <lthread.h>`

Pass `-llthread` to gcc to use lthread in your program.

Library calls
-------------

### Timeout Notes

Timeout is in milliseconds for functions that takes `timeout` argument

Timeout value of 0 means never timeout.

```C
/*
 * Creates a new lthread and returns it via `*new_lt`.
 * Returns 0 if success, -1 on failure.
 */
int lthread_create(lthread_t **new_lt, void (*lthread_func)(void *), void *arg);
```

```C
/*
 * Cancels an lthread and events it was expecting.
 */
void lthread_cancel(lthread_t *lt);
```

```C
/*
 * Blocks until all lthreads created have exited.
 */
void lthread_run(void);
```

```C
/*
 * Marks the current lthread as detached, causing it to
 * get freed once it exits. Otherwise `lthread_join()` must be
 * called on the lthread to free it up.
 * If an lthread wasn't marked as detached and wasn't joined on then
 * a memory leak occurs.
 */
void lthread_detach(void);
```

```C
/*
 * Blocks the calling lthread until lt has exited or timeout occurred.
 * In case of timeout, lthread_join returns -2 and lt doesn't get freed.
 * If target lthread was cancelled, it returns -1 and the target lthread
 * will be freed.
 * **ptr will get populated by lthread_exit(). ptr cannot be from lthread's
 * stack space.
 * Joining on a joined lthread has undefined behavior.
 * Returns 0 on success, -1 on cancelled target lthread, -2 on timeout.
 */
int lthread_join(lthread_t *lt, void **ptr, uint_64 timeout);
```

```C
/*
 * Sets ptr value for the joining lthread and exits lthread.
 */
void lthread_exit(void **ptr);
```

```C
/*
 * Moves lthread into a pthread to run its expensive computation or make a blocking 
 * call like `gethostbyname()`.
 * This call *must* be followed by lthread_compute_end() after the computation and/or
 * blocking calls have been made to resume the lthread in its original lthread scheduler.
 * No lthread_* calls can be made during lthread_compute_begin()/lthread_compute_end(). 
 */
 void lthread_compute_begin(void);
```

```C
/*
 * Moves lthread from pthread back to the lthread scheduler it was running on.
 */
 void lthread_compute_end(void);
```

```C
/*
 * Puts an lthread to sleep until msecs have passed. msecs=0 yields.
 */
void lthread_sleep(uint64_t msecs);
```

```C
/* 
 * Wake up a sleeping lthread. 
 */
void lthread_wakeup(lthread_t *lt);
```

```C
/* 
 * Creates a condition variable that can be used between lthreads to block/signal each other.
 */
int lthread_cond_create(lthread_cond_t **c);
```

```C
/*
 * Puts the lthread calling `lthread_cond_wait` to sleep until `timeout` expires or another lthread signals it.
 * Returns 0 if it was signaled or -2 if it expired.
 */
int lthread_cond_wait(lthread_cond_t *c, uint64_t timeout);
```


```C
/*
 * Signals a single lthread blocked on `lthread_cond_wait` to wake up and resume.
 */
void lthread_cond_signal(lthread_cond_t *c);
```

```C
/*
 * Signals all lthreads blocked on `lthread_cond_wait` to wake up and resume.
 */
void lthread_cond_broadcast(lthread_cond_t *c);
```

```C
/*
 * Returns the value set for the current lthread.
 */
void *lthread_get_data(void);
```

```C
/* 
 * Sets data bound to the lthread. This value can be retrieved anywhere in the lthread using `lthread_get_data()`.
 */
void lthread_set_data(void *data);
```


```C
/*
 * Returns the lthread Id.
 */
uint64_t lthread_id();
```


```C
/*
 * Returns a pointer to the current lthread.
 */
lthread_t *lthread_current();
```

```C
/*
 * Sets the lthread method name to the current function.
 * It makes debugging easier by knowing which function a specific lthread was executing.
 */
void lthread_set_funcname(const char *f);

You can use a shortcut macro `DEFINE_LTHREAD;` to set the function name. 
```

### A simple timer in lthread

```C

#include <lthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/time.h>

void
a(void *x)
{
    int i = 3;
    DEFINE_LTHREAD;
    struct timeval t1 = {0, 0};
    struct timeval t2 = {0, 0};
    printf("I am in a\n");
    lthread_detach();

    while (i--) {
        gettimeofday(&t1, NULL);
        lthread_sleep(2000);
        gettimeofday(&t2, NULL);
        printf("a (%d): elapsed is: %ld\n",i ,t2.tv_sec - t1.tv_sec);
    }
    printf("a is exiting\n");
}

void
b(void *x)
{
    int i = 8;
    DEFINE_LTHREAD;
    struct timeval t1 = {0, 0};
    struct timeval t2 = {0, 0};
    printf("I am in b\n");
    lthread_detach();

    while (i--) {
        gettimeofday(&t1, NULL);
        lthread_sleep(1000);
        gettimeofday(&t2, NULL);
        printf("b (%d): elapsed is: %ld\n",i ,t2.tv_sec - t1.tv_sec);
    }
    printf("b is exiting\n");
}

void
c(void *x)
{
    DEFINE_LTHREAD;
	printf("c is running\n");
    lthread_compute_begin();
        sleep(1);
    lthread_compute_end();
	printf("c is exiting\n");
}

void
d(void *x)
{
	lthread_t *lt_new = NULL;

    DEFINE_LTHREAD;
    lthread_detach();

    printf("d is running\n");
    lthread_create(&lt_new, c, NULL);
    lthread_join(lt_new, NULL, 0);
    printf("d is done joining on c.\n");
}

int
main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    lthread_t *lt = NULL;

    lthread_create(&lt, a, NULL);
    lthread_create(&lt, b, NULL);
    lthread_create(&lt, d, NULL);
    lthread_run();

    return 0;
}

```

### An incomplete web server to illustrate some of lthread features

In this example, the dummy http server will accept a connection, runs a relatively expensive fibonacci(35) in lthread_compute_begin() / lthread_compute_end() and replies back.

While fibonacci is running, we'll continue to accept new connections and handle them without blocking because fibonacci is running between lthread_compute_begin() and lthread_compute_end(), which moves the lthread into a pthread and resumes it there until lthread_compute_end() is called and that's when it moves back to its previous scheduler.
